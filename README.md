Smart Parking System

A Python-based intelligent parking management system with a graphical interface, automated spot allocation, dynamic rate management, and real-time duration tracking. This project uses Tkinter for the GUI and implements multiple search algorithms for optimal parking spot assignment based on vehicle type.

⸻

Features
	•	Automated Spot Assignment: Allocates the best available spot using BFS, DFS, or A* search algorithms depending on vehicle type.
	•	Vehicle Type Support: Supports Cars, Bikes, SUVs, and Electric Vehicles, each with unique parking preferences and rates.
	•	Dynamic Rate Management: Admin interface to update hourly rates for each vehicle type.
	•	Real-Time Duration Tracking: Displays live parking durations for all occupied spots.
	•	Reserved Parking: Designated spots for handicapped and VIP users.
	•	Interactive GUI: Easy-to-use interface for check-in, check-out, and lot management.
	•	Help & User Guide: Built-in help window and about section for user assistance.

Usage

Check-In a Vehicle
	1.	Select the vehicle type from the dropdown (Car, Bike, SUV, Electric).
	2.	Click Check In.
	3.	The system will assign the optimal spot and display the spot number, rate, and check-in time.

Check-Out a Vehicle
	1.	Click Check Out.
	2.	Enter your assigned spot number (e.g., A3, B4).
	3.	The system will calculate the total charges based on duration and display a summary.

Admin: Update Rates
	1.	Go to Admin > Update Rates in the menu bar.
	2.	Update hourly rates for each vehicle type.
	3.	Click Save Changes.

Reset Lot
	•	Use the Reset Lot button or File > Reset Lot to clear all parked vehicles and restore reserved spots.

Help
	•	Access Help > User Guide for detailed instructions and tips.
	•	Help > About provides version and credits information.

Parking Lot Details
	•	5x5 Grid (25 spots)
	•	Reserved Spots:
	•	A1: Handicapped
	•	A2: VIP
	•	Spot Naming: A1–E5 (Rows A–E, Columns 1–5)
	•	Vehicle-Specific Allocation:
	•	Car: Closest to entrance (BFS)
	•	Bike: Flexible, can use farther spots (DFS)
	•	SUV: Prefers edge spots (A*)
	•	Electric: Spots near charging points (A*)

⸻

Algorithms

Vehicle Type	Search Algorithm	Allocation Preference
Car	BFS	Closest to entrance
Bike	DFS	Any available, including farther spots
SUV	A*	Edge spots, optimal path
Electric	A*	Near charging points (entrance side)



⸻

Customization
	•	Change Grid Size: Modify the self.parking_lot initialization in the code.
	•	Add More Vehicle Types: Update the self.rates dictionary and spot assignment logic.
	•	Reserved Spots: Adjust the initialization in reset_lot() and __init__() methods.
