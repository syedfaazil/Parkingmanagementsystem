# Smart Parking System

A Python-based intelligent parking management system with a graphical interface, automated spot allocation, dynamic rate management, and real-time duration tracking. This project uses **Tkinter** for the GUI and implements multiple search algorithms for optimal parking spot assignment based on vehicle type.

---

## Features

- **Automated Spot Assignment:** Allocates the best available spot using **BFS**, **DFS**, or **A*** search algorithms depending on vehicle type.
- **Vehicle Type Support:** Supports **Cars**, **Bikes**, **SUVs**, and **Electric Vehicles**, each with unique parking preferences and rates.
- **Dynamic Rate Management:** Admin interface to update hourly rates for each vehicle type.
- **Real-Time Duration Tracking:** Displays live parking durations for all occupied spots.
- **Reserved Parking:** Designated spots for handicapped and VIP users.
- **Interactive GUI:** Easy-to-use interface for check-in, check-out, and lot management.
- **Help & User Guide:** Built-in help window and about section for user assistance.

## Usage

### Check-In a Vehicle

1. Select the vehicle type from the dropdown (**Car**, **Bike**, **SUV**, **Electric**).
2. Click **Check In**.
3. The system will assign the optimal spot and display the spot number, rate, and check-in time.

### Check-Out a Vehicle

1. Click **Check Out**.
2. Enter your assigned spot number (e.g., `A3`, `B4`).
3. The system will calculate the total charges based on duration and display a summary.

### Admin: Update Rates

1. Go to **Admin > Update Rates** in the menu bar.
2. Update hourly rates for each vehicle type.
3. Click **Save Changes**.

### Reset Lot

- Use the **Reset Lot** button or **File > Reset Lot** to clear all parked vehicles and restore reserved spots.

### Help

- Access **Help > User Guide** for detailed instructions and tips.
- **Help > About** provides version and credits information.

## Parking Lot Details

- **5x5 Grid** (25 spots)
- **Reserved Spots:**
  - `A1`: Handicapped
  - `A2`: VIP
- **Spot Naming:** `A1â€“E5` (Rows `Aâ€“E`, Columns `1â€“5`)
- **Vehicle-Specific Allocation:**
  - **Car:** Closest to entrance (**BFS**)
  - **Bike:** Flexible, can use farther spots (**DFS**)
  - **SUV:** Prefers edge spots (**A***)
  - **Electric:** Spots near charging points (**A***)

## Algorithms

| Vehicle Type | Search Algorithm | Allocation Preference                     |
|--------------|------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Car          | BFS              | Closest to entrance                       |
| Bike         | DFS              | Any available, including farther spots    |
| SUV          | A*               | Edge spots, optimal path                  |
| Electric     | A*               | Near charging points (entrance side)      |

---

## Customization

- **Change Grid Size:** Modify the `self.parking_lot` initialization in the code.
- **Add More Vehicle Types:** Update the `self.rates` dictionary and spot assignment logic.
- **Reserved Spots:** Adjust the initialization in `reset_lot()` and `__init__()` methods.
